/**
 * Checks that a pull-request body was written FOR A READER, not just written.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The template has been enforced since #250 (2026-08-28): three sections must
 * exist and be non-empty. Both #254 and #255 complied, and both were still unreadable at a glance —
 * 651 and 866 words, Summary bullets packing four facts each in plan-internal vocabulary, a
 * verification section that was a wall of test counts with no baseline, and no demonstration of a
 * feature that shipped a state machine. Presence is not the property; the property is that a
 * reader who was not in the session can see what changed. This script measures the parts of that
 * a machine can measure, and no more.
 *
 * WHAT IT MEASURES, stated exactly:
 *   FAIL  · `Summary`, `How it was verified`, `Notes for Reviewers` exist and are non-empty once
 *           HTML comments are stripped (unchanged from the workflow's inline check it replaces).
 *   FAIL  · `Demonstration` exists and is non-empty when the title's conventional-commit type is
 *           feat / fix / perf / refactor. `n/a: <reason>` satisfies it — the point is that the
 *           author DECIDED, not that every PR carries a diagram.
 *   FAIL  · a `___` placeholder survives outside HTML comments — the `pr:body` skeleton seeds
 *           them, so a surviving one means the body was generated and never edited. Without this
 *           rule the generator+gate pair would MINT a new theatre path: a body that passes while
 *           saying nothing (ruled 2026-09-02, blind-spot pass).
 *   FAIL  · a row of the verification table has every cell after the first empty — the skeleton's
 *           unfilled shape, same reasoning as the placeholder rule.
 *   FAIL  · a `Plan:` footer names a plan whose frontmatter `status:` is still non-final
 *           (active / backlog / proposal / draft / loaded / reserved), or names a file that does
 *           not exist at this checkout. Ruled 2026-09-02: the footer is a CONTRACT, not a
 *           pointer — a PR carrying a plan does not merge until that plan is finalized in it.
 *           The footer is also the ONLY sanctioned plan mention; row ids and plan vocabulary in
 *           the body are the session voice this whole file exists to keep out.
 *   FAIL  · a `Plan:` footer with no `Initiative:` trailer — the initiative slug is the join key
 *           `git log --grep` reads across a multi-PR initiative, and a plan footer with no
 *           initiative trailer is a dangling join.
 *   FAIL  · a `Decision:` trailer naming an ADR number with no `<adrDir>/<NNNN>-*.md` file at this
 *           checkout — the trailer asserts a decision exists; this checks that assertion the same
 *           way the `Plan:` footer's existence check does.
 *   WARN  · above-the-fold text over WORD_BUDGET words. Fenced blocks, tables, and everything
 *           inside `<details>` are NOT counted: the body is a two-register document (reader voice
 *           above the fold, collapsed archive appendix below), and the budget bounds only the
 *           part a reader must traverse. The first version counted transcripts and warned
 *           hardest on the most compliant PRs — the advisory-rot path.
 *   WARN  · `How it was verified` carries no table and no fenced block.
 *
 * It does NOT judge prose quality, and it does not read the title beyond its type — the title is
 * commitlint's job (the workflow runs commitlint on it with the repo's own config, so the two
 * cannot drift).
 *
 * ZERO DEPENDENCIES, ON PURPOSE, AND SELF-CONTAINED. The workflow runs this before any install so
 * it works on the docs route, and this file has zero imports outside `node:` built-ins — including
 * the plan-row lifecycle primitive (`planRowStates`), which is defined and exported here rather
 * than imported from a sibling repository, so a consumer of this template never reaches outside
 * its own tree. `scripts/pr-body.mjs` imports `checkBody` (and, transitively, `planRowStates`) from
 * this one file, so the generator and the gate share one definition of "ready".
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/validate-pr-body.mjs --body-file <path> --title "<pr title>"
 *   PR_BODY="..." PR_TITLE="..." node scripts/validate-pr-body.mjs
 *   node scripts/validate-pr-body.mjs --self-test
